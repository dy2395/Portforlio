       Denise (Danqi Yin) is a full-stack web developer and also a "soft-ware" engineer. She is very into making this world a better place that she forgets about herself sometimes :P. She used to study environmental science and engineering with a goal to protect the environment. She then works as a solar project engineer who aims to promote renewable energy along with sustainble development for the good of people. Now she wants to help build a brighter future for both human and nature on the powerful Internet.
